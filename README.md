stm32f4-examples
================

Examples programs for STM32F4Discovery board. These examples were written while I was exploring STM32F407VGT microcontroller. I think this may be helpful for somebody.

stm32f4d_template
-----------------

This is Eclipse project template for STM32F4Discovery board

Test-Leds
-----------

This is "Hello world" project. Simple blinking LEDs on board.

LAB01-LED-GPIO
--------------

This lab is to change LED states by user button through GPIO setting.

LAB01-LED-Interrupt
-------------------

This lab is to change LED states by user button through interrupt.

LAB02-PWM
----------

This lab is to change LED's brightness with PWM.

LAB03-USART
-----------

This lab is to receive a byte  from smartphone and send it back ,through USART(bluetooth).

LAB04-ADC
---------

This lab is to detect the voltage data on pin by ADC and send the data to smartphone through bluetooth.
